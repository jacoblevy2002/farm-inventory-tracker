# Farming Inventory Tracker

**Farming Inventory Tracker** is an inventory tracker designed for Android apps, with an emphasis on farming supplies and products. It was created in collaboration with [Jayden Ramhit](https://jaydenramhit.github.io) and [Samuel Augunas](https://saugunas.github.io).

The app features inventory lists for planted crops, miscellaneous supplies, and tools, all of which can be added by the user. Objects in the list can be deleted by swiping on their entry on the main page, and can be added by using the menu at the top of the screen.
- Supplies can be added with a type and starting amount. If the type is already in the list, it will add to the total; otherwise, it will create a new type in the list.
- Tools can be added with a name, price, and stock amount.
- Crops can be added with a date planted, type, and list of supplies used. Types that have been already in the past are offered in a drop down menu for ease of access, or a new type can be written in. When a supply is used on a crop, the stock amount automatically goes down in the other list, and a notification is sent when the amount gets low.
The app also contains various smaller features, such as the option to share your lists in text form, the ability to change the app's font, and a dark mode.

This project was created in over the course of November and December 2022 as the final project for an Application Development class.
